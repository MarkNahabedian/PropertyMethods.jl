PropertyMethods is a small package that allows one to add computed
properties to a struct by defining a `Val` specialized method for each
property.  Unrelated properties no longer need to be enumerated in the
conditional tree of a single `getproperty` method.

Properties defined in this way will automatically be
recognized by the struct's `propertynames` and `hasproperty` methods.

This mackage also provides a macro to generate trampoline methods for
the *Delegation* pattern.

See the documentation linked above for details.
